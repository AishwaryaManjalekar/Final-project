# Final-project


The Onlineshop is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction.

MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a software architecture pattern, which separates application into three areas: model, view, and controller. The model represents a Java object carrying data. The view represents the visualization of the data that the model contains. The controller controls the data flow into model object and updates the view when the data changes. It separates the view and model.
